# PHP_Rock-Paper-Scissors_with-user-validation
Rock Paper Scissors game with user validation, salt encryption and simple game mechanics


input the user name and password (hidden in the source code) to play rock paper scissors.
In this code, user validation is taken from the "POST" method, stored as user data, then later used to access the game.
Part of the game mechanics include, randomising a choice from an array (in this case containing the values: rock,paper,scissors), comparing user vs computer choice to determine the winner, a test option which uses nested if statements to test all combinations and print its results.

Part of my uni assignment. 

credit to https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css, their CSS framework is awesome, really appreciate the work they've put on this.

not meant for small screens.

still need to fix the test part at the end of the game.php script
