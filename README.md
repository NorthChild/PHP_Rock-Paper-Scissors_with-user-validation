Rock Paper Scissors game with user validation


Part of my uni assignment, input the user name and password to play rock paper scissors.
In this code, user validation is taken from the "POST" method, stored as user data, then later used to access the game.

credit to https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css, their CSS framework is awesome, really appreciate the work they've put on this.
